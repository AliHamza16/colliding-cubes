# Calculating PI with colliding cubes

In any collision, momentum is conserved; but in an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved. Based on this, I wrote a program that calculates and animates the velocity of two blocks of known mass and velocity after a collision.

If one block weighs 100^x times the other, the total number of collisions gives the digits of pi.
